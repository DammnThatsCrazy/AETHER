# Deployment Profile Matrix

All flags default OFF; enabling is per-capability and per-domain.

| Capability | Local (in-memory) | Staging | Production |
|---|---|---|---|
| Stablecoin ingestion/valuation/flows | ✅ works (in-memory stores) | Postgres via Alembic | blocked on staging validation |
| Stablecoin finality (live chains) | fixture-driven only | needs RPC credentials | blocked |
| Derivatives runtime + simulator | ✅ full conformance locally | Postgres via Alembic | blocked on venue adapters |
| Derivatives streams | local asyncio transport | Kafka topics not provisioned | blocked |
| Interop lifecycle/correlation | ✅ fixture-driven | Postgres via Alembic | blocked |
| Public agent marketplace catalog | OFF by default; bounded parser tests | opt-in observer with durable store | opt-in observer with durable store |
| LayerZero live scanning | ❌ (CREDENTIAL_GATED) | needs per-chain RPC | blocked |
| Gold materialization | in-memory GoldRepository | ClickHouse not provisioned | blocked |
| Frontend surfaces | ✅ against local backend | flag-gated | flag-gated |

Env blocks are documented in `config/environments/.env.example`
(`AETHER_STABLECOIN_*`, `AETHER_DERIVATIVES_*`, `AETHER_INTEROP_*`,
`AETHER_AGENT_MARKETPLACE_CATALOG_*`,
`KYBER_*_OPS_ENABLED`); `Settings.__post_init__` rejects incoherent
combinations (LayerZero without adapters).
