# Graph Projection Model

8.12.0 adds 8 vertex types and 82 edge types; the per-domain alignment
docs (`STABLECOIN_GRAPH_ALIGNMENT`, `DERIVATIVES_GRAPH_ALIGNMENT`,
`INTEROP_GRAPH_ALIGNMENT`) carry the full lists.

Cross-domain rules:

- High-cardinality facts (observations, orders, fills, positions,
  messages) are NEVER vertices — they stay silver facts.
- Actor edges participate in the four layers (H2H/H2A/A2H/A2A); domain
  topology edges are `EXCLUDED`. Every new edge is mapped in
  `_EDGE_LAYER_MAP`; `assert_contract_valid()` and the exhaustiveness
  test fail on unmapped edges.
- A2H edges exist in BOTH `packages/shared/graph-contract.ts` and the
  Python map — `tests/unit/test_graph_contract_parity.py` asserts set
  equality (the 7 derivatives A2H edges and interop `RELAYED_FOR` are
  covered).
- All mutations flow through `build_edge_properties` (tenant, actor,
  provenance, valid_from, source_event_id, idempotency key) and
  `persist_mutations`, gated per domain by `*_graph_enabled` flags.
