## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Restored ML compatibility interfaces so the `ML Models/aether-ml/tests` suite passes again after prior API refactors removed legacy entry points.
- Fixed timezone mismatches in identity feature aggregation that caused tz-aware vs tz-naive subtraction failures.
- Hardened the serving API test/dev path with deterministic fallback models and corrected response-contract mismatches for `/models`, batch prediction errors, and missing feature validation.
- Expanded repository health automation so CI covers both the root test suite and the ML subproject suite.
- Ignored local Gradle caches so Android developer artifacts no longer show up as untracked repository changes.

### Changed

- Documented branch-protection requirements in the generated automation policy so GitHub's unprotected-`main` warning has a repeatable remediation path and the `Repo Health / validate` check can be enforced.
- Made `.github/workflows/repo-health.yml` a generated artifact of `scripts/sync_docs.py` and documented a merge-conflict recovery flow so concurrent edits to repo-health automation are resolved from one source of truth.

### Model Extraction Defense Layer

Modular defense layer protecting ML serving endpoints against model extraction and knowledge distillation attacks. Audited the inference pipeline and found critical vulnerability — 9 models exposed with exact probability outputs, no perturbation, no watermarking, and no query anomaly detection.

### Added

- **Query Rate Limiter** (`security/model_extraction_defense/rate_limiter.py`) — dual-axis sliding window rate limiting (per-API-key + per-IP), three time windows each (minute/hour/day), batch cost accounting
- **Query Pattern Detector** (`security/model_extraction_defense/pattern_detector.py`) — detects systematic feature sweeps, input similarity clustering, uniform random probing, and bot-like timing regularity
- **Output Perturbation Layer** (`security/model_extraction_defense/output_perturbation.py`) — logit noise injection, top-k probability clipping, entropy smoothing, precision rounding; noise scales with extraction risk score
- **Model Watermarking** (`security/model_extraction_defense/watermark.py`) — HMAC-based probabilistic bias embedding in outputs; statistically detectable across many queries for forensic identification of extracted models
- **Canary Input Detector** (`security/model_extraction_defense/canary_detector.py`) — secret-seed-generated trap inputs with lazy initialization from observed feature dimensionality; triggers cooldown on detection
- **Extraction Risk Scorer** (`security/model_extraction_defense/risk_scorer.py`) — EMA-smoothed aggregate score combining velocity, pattern anomaly, similarity, and entropy signals; drives response degradation across four tiers (normal/elevated/high/critical)
- **Defense Metrics** (`security/model_extraction_defense/metrics.py`) — thread-safe metrics collector with Prometheus exposition format export; tracks requests, blocks, canary triggers, risk distribution
- **Background Cleanup** (`security/model_extraction_defense/cleanup.py`) — daemon thread, asyncio coroutine, and Celery beat task modes for periodic expiration of in-memory state
- **Admin CLI** (`security/model_extraction_defense/admin_cli.py`) — watermark verification against suspect models, canary generation, metrics inspection
- **`ModelExtractionDefenseConfig`** in `Backend Architecture/aether-backend/config/settings.py` — 16 environment variables with production validation for secret keys
- **`EXTRACTION_DEFENSE_AUDIT.md`** — comprehensive audit report with threat model covering 4 attack scenarios

### Changed

- **ML Serving API** (`ML Models/aether-ml/serving/src/api.py`) — all 8 prediction endpoints + batch endpoint now wrapped with extraction defense middleware and post-response perturbation
- **Backend Middleware** (`Backend Architecture/aether-backend/middleware/middleware.py`) — extraction defense checks integrated into request lifecycle for `/v1/ml/predict` routes

### Stats

- **13 new files**, **4 modified files** — 4,500+ lines added
- All protections gated behind `ENABLE_EXTRACTION_DEFENSE=false` (default off)
- Zero latency impact when disabled; <2ms overhead when enabled

## [8.3.0] — 2026-03-10

### Provider Gateway: BYOK, Failover & Usage Metering

Unified abstraction layer for all third-party provider calls. Tenants can bring their own API keys (encrypted at rest), the system automatically fails over between providers using circuit breakers, and every call is metered per-tenant for billing and monitoring.

### Added

- **Provider Gateway** (`shared/providers/`) — multi-provider abstraction with 4 categories: blockchain RPC (QuickNode, Alchemy, Infura, custom), block explorer (Etherscan, Moralis), social API (Twitter, Reddit), analytics data (Dune Analytics)
- **BYOK (Bring Your Own Key)** — tenants store encrypted API keys via `POST /v1/providers/keys`; keys are automatically used for routing at request time with Fernet encryption at rest
- **Automatic failover** — `AdaptiveRouter` implements priority chain: tenant BYOK → system default → fallback provider(s) → `ServiceUnavailableError`. Composes with existing `ErrorRegistry` circuit breakers
- **Usage metering** — `UsageMeter` tracks per-tenant, per-provider call counts, latency, success rates, and method-level breakdown
- **Admin API** — 8 endpoints under `/v1/providers/`: key CRUD, usage stats, usage summary, health monitoring, category listing, and provider testing
- **9 concrete provider adapters** — QuickNodeProvider, AlchemyProvider, InfuraProvider, GenericRPCProvider, EtherscanProvider, MoralisProvider, TwitterProvider, RedditProvider, DuneAnalyticsProvider
- **`ProviderGatewayConfig`** in `config/settings.py` — 12 environment variables with feature flag (`PROVIDER_GATEWAY_ENABLED=false` default)
- **`ProviderGateway` facade** in `dependencies/providers.py` — owns key vault, registry, meter, and router lifecycle

### Changed

- **`RPCGateway`** — delegates through Provider Gateway when enabled; falls back to direct QuickNode on failure (fully backwards compatible)
- **`main.py`** — mounts providers router (service count 17 → 18 core, 21 total with IG)
- **Backend Architecture README** — updated service count, diagrams, endpoint listing, project structure, and configuration reference

### Stats

- **10 new files**, **4 modified files** — 1,720 lines added
- Backend service count: 20 → 21 (18 core + 3 IG)

## [8.2.0] — 2026-03-07

### Automatic Traffic Source Detection

Server-side traffic source classification with full-stack signal capture. SDKs collect raw referrer, UTM params, and click IDs — the backend classifies every session into source/medium/channel automatically. No pre-created links required.

### Added

- **SourceClassifier** (`services/traffic/classifier.py`) — stateless, pure-function classifier with O(1) domain lookup tables covering 40+ social platforms, 17+ search engines, 14 email providers, and 12 ad platform click IDs. Uses a priority chain: Click IDs (confidence 1.0) → UTM params (0.95) → Referrer domain (0.9) → Direct (0.5). Email domains checked before search to prevent `mail.google.com` misclassification
- **Web SDK: `referrerDomain` field** — `TrafficSourceData` now includes a parsed `referrerDomain` (with `www.` stripped) for backend classification
- **Web SDK: SPA session persistence** — `sessionStorage`-based caching ensures traffic source data survives client-side SPA navigations without losing the original referrer
- **iOS SDK: 12 click ID capture** — `handleDeepLink()` expanded from 2 (gclid, fbclid) to 12 ad platform click IDs (gclid, msclkid, fbclid, ttclid, twclid, li_fat_id, rdt_cid, scid, dclid, epik, irclickid, aff_id)
- **iOS SDK: campaign context in events** — `CampaignInfo` expanded with `content`, `term`, `clickIds`, `referrerDomain` fields; now wired into `buildContext()` so every event includes campaign attribution data
- **Android SDK: 12 click ID capture** — `handleDeepLink()` expanded from 3 (gclid, fbclid, msclkid) to 12 ad platform click IDs
- **Android SDK: campaign context in events** — new `campaignContext` JSONObject wired into `buildContext()` with source, medium, campaign, content, term, clickIds, referrerDomain
- **`confidence` field on `SourceInfo`** — classifier confidence score (0.0–1.0) now stored with each classified traffic source

### Changed

- **Traffic source classification** — `traffic_type` field on traffic sources is now automatically populated by the backend classifier instead of always arriving as `"unknown"` from the SDK. Channel breakdowns in `/v1/analytics/channels` now return meaningful categories (Paid Search, Organic Social, Email, Direct, Referral, etc.)
- **`POST /v1/track/traffic-source`** — now runs raw signals through `SourceClassifier` before storage, overriding SDK-provided source/medium/traffic_type with classified values

### Stats

- **5 files changed** — 1 new, 4 modified
- **~277 lines added** — zero classification logic in any SDK

## [8.1.0] — 2026-03-07

### Security Hardening, Bug Fixes & Diagnostics System

Comprehensive remediation of 51 issues discovered during deep code review (5 CRITICAL, 18 HIGH, 18 MEDIUM, 10 LOW). Adds a centralized automatic error handling and diagnostics system with circuit breakers, error fingerprinting, and real-time health monitoring.

### Added

- **Diagnostics Service** (`/v1/diagnostics/`) — centralized error tracking and monitoring system with 6 admin-only endpoints: `GET /health`, `GET /errors`, `GET /report`, `POST /errors/{fingerprint}/resolve`, `POST /errors/{fingerprint}/suppress`, `GET /circuit-breakers`
- **ErrorRegistry** (`shared/diagnostics/error_registry.py`) — automatic error classification engine with SHA-256 fingerprinting for deduplication, 13 error categories, 5 severity levels, and 11 built-in classification rules mapping exceptions to remediation advice
- **CircuitBreaker** — per-operation circuit breaker pattern (5 failures → open, 30s recovery) preventing cascading failures across services
- **`@track_error` decorator** — wraps async functions for automatic error registration, circuit breaker enforcement, and success tracking without swallowing exceptions
- **RPC method allowlist** (`services/onchain/rpc_gateway.py`) — restricts executable RPC methods to a curated set of safe EVM and Solana read methods, blocking arbitrary method execution

### Fixed

#### Critical

- **C-1: Race condition in x402 economic graph** — added `asyncio.Lock` and copy-and-swap pattern for concurrent `_payments` list mutation; `snapshot_to_graph()` now acquires lock, copies payments, clears list, releases lock before iterating
- **C-2: Hardcoded JWT secret** — `Settings.__post_init__` now raises `RuntimeError` when non-local environments use the default `"change-me-in-production"` secret
- **C-3: Hardcoded API key stub** — `APIKeyValidator` now only accepts `_STUB_KEYS` in `LOCAL` environment; non-local environments reject stub keys with `UnauthorizedError`
- **C-4: Agent IG endpoints not feature-flagged** — all 6 Intelligence Graph agent endpoints now check `settings.intelligence_graph.enable_agent_layer` before execution; trust endpoint additionally checks `enable_trust_scoring`
- **C-5: Audit engine never wired** — trail name mismatch fixed with `trail_key_map` dictionary mapping config names (`"Application Audit"`) to actual trail keys (`"application"`)

#### High

- **H-SEC1: RPC method injection** — added `ALLOWED_RPC_METHODS` allowlist blocking arbitrary method execution through the RPC gateway
- **H-SEC2: x402 header parsing** — added 8KB size limit, amount validation (non-negative numeric), rejection of malformed non-JSON headers
- **H-SEC3: Fraud routes unauthenticated** — added `request: Request` parameter and permission checks (`fraud:evaluate`, `fraud:read`, `admin`) to all 5 fraud service endpoints
- **H-SEC4/5: Cross-tenant data leakage** — added `tenant_id` parameter to commerce service, x402 economic graph, and agent lifecycle stores; all query methods now filter by tenant
- **H-SEC6: sendBeacon API key leak** — moved API key from URL query parameter (`?key=...`) to JSON request body to prevent key exposure in server logs, referrer headers, and browser history
- **H-SEC7: Audit trail name mismatch** — `retention_report()` now correctly maps config names to trail keys via lookup dictionary
- **H-LB2: Trust score inflated for unknown entities** — reduced default `identity_confidence` and `session_score` from `0.5` to `0.1`; unknown entities now score ~0.15 composite instead of ~0.70
- **H-EH1: x402 capture lost on event failure** — transaction now appended to `_captures` before event publishing; publish failure logged but doesn't block capture
- **H-EH2: On-chain action recorder** — graph operations wrapped in try/except; failures logged but action still recorded locally

#### Medium

- **M-1:** Fixed double "not found" in `NotFoundError` messages for on-chain contract lookups
- **M-2:** Bytecode risk scorer now receives `bytecode_opcodes` from action metadata instead of always scoring empty input
- **M-3:** RPC cache key changed from non-deterministic `hash()` to stable `hashlib.sha256().hexdigest()[:16]`
- **M-4:** Fixed `params: list[Any] = None` type annotation to `Optional[list[Any]]`
- **M-5:** RPC rate limiter now uses `asyncio.Lock` to prevent race conditions under concurrent requests
- **M-6:** Gremlin escape regex expanded from `['\\x00-\x1f]` to include `"`, `` ` ``, and `;` to prevent injection
- **M-7:** `Content-Length` header parsing wrapped in `try/except` to handle malformed values gracefully
- **M-8:** DSR erasure cascade extended to SERVICE (CONSUMES edges), PROTOCOL (INTERACTS_WITH edges), and x402 in-memory store; portability export now includes IG data
- **M-9:** SDK 429 retry now respects `maxRetries` bound instead of recursing indefinitely
- **M-10:** Removed unused `edges` variable in `get_layer_subgraph()`
- **M-11:** `EventConsumer` recursive retry replaced with bounded `while` loop to prevent stack overflow
- **M-12:** Confidence delta changed from binary (0/1) to graduated similarity using `SequenceMatcher`

#### Low

- **L-1:** Fee elimination rounding unified to 4 decimal places across commerce and x402 services
- **L-2:** Trust score constructor type annotations and docstring added
- **L-3:** Dead `SERVICE_PURCHASED` and `FEE_ELIMINATED` topics marked with `# Reserved` comments
- **L-5:** DSR `stores_processed`/`stores_remaining` type annotations changed from `list` to `list[str]`

### Changed

- **SDK types** — added 5 new event interfaces (`AgentTaskEvent`, `AgentDecisionEvent`, `PaymentEvent`, `X402PaymentEvent`, `ContractActionEvent`); `AetherEvent` discriminated union extended from 7 to 12 members
- **SDK EventType** — added `'experiment'` and `'performance'` to the `EventType` string literal union
- **Backend service count** — updated from 15 to 17 core services (added diagnostics service)

- **Bytecode Risk scorer** — rule-based static analysis scoring 10 patterns (reentrancy, selfdestruct, delegatecall, tx.origin, unchecked-send, uninitialized-storage, overflow, flash-loan, proxy-abuse, hidden-mint) on a 0.0-1.0 scale
- **Anomaly Detection extension** — 6 new feature columns (agent_action_rate, payment_velocity, contract_deploy_frequency, x402_amount_zscore, cross_layer_hop_count, trust_score_delta) added to existing anomaly detection model
- **Agent service extensions** — agent registration with capability declaration, lifecycle management (active/paused/terminated), autonomous decision recording with rationale capture, ground truth feedback loop for decision quality scoring
- **2 new consent purposes** (`agent`, `commerce`) with CONSENT_MAP routing: `agent_task`/`agent_decision` -> `'agent'`, `payment`/`x402_payment` -> `'commerce'`, `contract_action` -> `'web3'`
- **DSR cascade extended** to new vertex types — data subject access/erasure/portability requests now cascade through AGENT, PAYMENT, CONTRACT, and ACTION_RECORD vertices in addition to existing User, Wallet, Email, Phone, and DeviceFingerprint vertices

## [7.0.0] — 2026-03-05

### Thin-Client Architecture, Identity Resolution, and DRY Consolidation

Major architectural shift to "Sense and Ship" thin-client design. SDKs now collect and ship raw events; all processing (identity resolution, ML inference, DeFi classification, funnel matching, heatmap generation) happens server-side. Cross-device identity resolution with hybrid deterministic + probabilistic matching. Full codebase DRY consolidation eliminating duplication across SDK, backend, and cross-platform modules.

### Changed

- **Web SDK** — stripped to thin client: removed all server-side logic, SDK now collects raw events and ships via POST /v1/events
- **iOS/Android/React Native SDKs** — aligned to thin-client architecture with identical event-shipping pattern
- **Backend** — expanded from 15 to 16 microservices with dedicated Identity Resolution service
- **Documentation** — complete rewrite of ARCHITECTURE.md, new IDENTITY-RESOLUTION.md, updated BACKEND-API.md with identity endpoints

### Refactored

- **DRY consolidation** — eliminated duplication across SDK packages, backend services, and cross-platform modules
- **Shared type definitions** — unified type system across TypeScript SDK and Python backend
- **Common utilities** — consolidated redundant helper functions into shared modules

### Stats

- **36 files changed** — 8 added, 28 modified

### Semantic Context, Traffic Source Tracking, and ML Optimization

Three cross-cutting platform enhancements: a tiered semantic context layer that enriches every event across all SDKs with consent-driven behavioral signals, zero-config automatic traffic source detection that identifies all inbound sources without pre-created links, and a modular ML optimization stack for production model compression and accuracy tuning.

### Added

- **Tiered Semantic Context — Web** (`packages/web/src/context/semantic-context.ts`) — `SemanticContextCollector` with 3-tier consent-driven enrichment:
  - **Tier 1 (Essential):** Timestamp, event ID, SDK version, basic device info (anonymized). Always collected.
  - **Tier 2 (Functional):** Journey stage inference (awareness → consideration → decision → retention), screen path history, session duration, scroll depth, active/idle time. Requires `analytics` consent.
  - **Tier 3 (Rich):** Inferred intent, sentiment signals (frustration via rage-clicks/errors, engagement via scroll/active-time, urgency via navigation speed, confusion via backtracking), interaction heatmaps (configurable grid bucketing), and precise error logs. Requires `analytics` + `marketing` consent.
  - Passive DOM listeners with proper cleanup, all signals 0-1 normalized.

- **Tiered Semantic Context — iOS** (`Aether Mobile SDK/SemanticContext.swift`) — `SemanticContextCollector` singleton with serial DispatchQueue thread safety, lifecycle observers (`didBecomeActive`, `didEnterBackground`, `willResignActive`), Codable types for JSON serialization.

- **Tiered Semantic Context — Android** (`Aether Mobile SDK/SemanticContext.kt`) — `SemanticContextCollector` Kotlin object with `CopyOnWriteArrayList` and `@Volatile` fields, returns `JSONObject` envelopes, requires `initialize(context)` call.

- **Tiered Semantic Context — React Native** (`packages/react-native/src/context/SemanticContext.ts`) — `RNSemanticContextCollector` with `AppState.addEventListener` for app state tracking, pre-instantiated singleton, session duration and screen path tracking.

- **Automatic Traffic Source Tracker** (`packages/web/src/tracking/traffic-source-tracker.ts`) — zero-config detection pipeline with priority resolution:
  1. UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_term`, `utm_content`)
  2. Ad click IDs across 12 platforms (`gclid`, `fbclid`, `msclkid`, `ttclid`, `twclid`, `li_fat_id`, `rdt_cid`, `scid`, `dclid`, `epik`, `irclickid`, `aff_id`)
  3. Referrer classification (27 social platforms, 15 search engines, 8 email providers)
  4. localStorage-persisted attribution with configurable 30-day window
  5. 12 traffic types: direct, organic, paid, social, email, referral, affiliate, push, sms, display, video, unknown

- **Traffic Source Backend Service** (`Backend Architecture/aether-backend/services/traffic/routes.py`) — FastAPI router with 5 endpoints: `POST /v1/traffic/sources` (register/upsert source), `POST /v1/traffic/events` (record traffic event), `GET /v1/traffic/sources` (list sources with filters), `GET /v1/traffic/sources/{id}` (get source by ID), `GET /v1/traffic/channels` (channel breakdown analytics). Pydantic models for request/response validation.

- **ML Quantization** (`ML Models/aether-ml/optimization/quantization.py`) — `ModelQuantizer` with 4 strategies: Dynamic (INT8 runtime), Static (INT8 calibrated), Weight-only (INT8 weights, FP32 activations), FP16. Includes tolerance checking with FP32 fallback and inference speedup benchmarking.

- **ML Distillation** (`ML Models/aether-ml/optimization/distillation.py`) — `ModelDistiller` with 3 modes: Soft-label (temperature-scaled probability transfer), Feature-matching (intermediate representation alignment), Progressive (iterative teacher shrinking). Supports data augmentation and configurable temperature scaling.

- **ML Pruning** (`ML Models/aether-ml/optimization/pruning.py`) — `ModelPruner` with 4 strategies: Magnitude (unstructured L1-norm), Structured (feature/neuron removal), Iterative (gradual pruning with fine-tune cycles), Sensitivity-aware (permutation importance-based). Automatic warm-start fine-tuning when accuracy drops.

- **ML Optimization Pipeline** (`ML Models/aether-ml/optimization/pipeline.py`) — `OptimizationPipeline` orchestrating Prune → Quantize → Distill with 3 pre-built profiles: Edge (INT8 dynamic + 30% magnitude pruning), Server (FP16 + 20% structured pruning), Aggressive (INT8 static + 50% iterative pruning). `OptimizationResult` with `summary()` method for reporting.

### Changed

- **Web SDK** (`packages/web/src/index.ts`) — Integrated `SemanticContextCollector` and `TrafficSourceTracker` into `init()`. Semantic context attached to every event via `enqueueEvent()`. Traffic source auto-detected on init and included in event payload. EdgeML callbacks inject intent and session score into semantic context. Cleanup on `destroy()`.

- **iOS SDK** (`Aether Mobile SDK/Aether.swift`) — `SemanticContextCollector.shared.resetSession()` called on init, `.recordScreen()` called on screen views, semantic context JSON injected into every event via `enqueueEvent()`.

- **Android SDK** (`Aether Mobile SDK/Aether.kt`) — `SemanticContextCollector.initialize()` and `.resetSession()` called on init, `.recordScreen()` called on screen views, semantic context injected into every event.

- **React Native** (`packages/react-native/src/index.tsx`) — Imported `semanticContext` singleton, `.resetSession()` called in `AetherProvider` mount, `.recordScreen()` called in `screenView()`, `.destroy()` called on unmount.

- **Backend** (`Backend Architecture/aether-backend/main.py`) — Added `traffic_router` as 11th service router.
